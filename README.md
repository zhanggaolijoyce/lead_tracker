I finish this small project under Scrimba(https://scrimba.com/playlist/pPD7Kt4)

It is a Google Chrome extension. It can help you save URLs from input or from current website tab to the local storage. So if you refresh the website or even open another browser, the URLs will remain in this extension window. Of course, you can delete these URLs manually. It can be used in e-commerce platforms, like you can save some shops which sell the same item, then compare the prices among them. Or you can also use it in job-hunting platforms, like LinkedIn, to store some people's pages whom you want to make connections with later.

I practiced my javascript skills through this project, especially for (1)function implementation after clicking a button, (2)template strings, (3)the use of localStorage.
